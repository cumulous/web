# SASSY UI

This project implements a web interface for
the Serverless Application System for Storage and analYsis (SASSY) of scientific data.

It builds upon [Angular 2](https://angular.io/) framework for single-page applications.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests locally via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

If you run these tests on a Linux system without a local display,
then you need to use `npm run headless e2e` instead.
This command starts a virtual framebuffer through Xvfb,
so make sure that Xvfb is present on your system.

Currently, Protractor is configured to test against the Chrome browser.
Please make sure its most recent version (>= 55) is also installed.
